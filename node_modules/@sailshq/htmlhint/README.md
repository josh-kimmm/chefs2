# @sailshq/htmlhint

A fork of HTMLHint 0.9.14 with ongoing maintenance from the [Sails core team](http://sailsjs.com/about).

This repo will only be updated when there are immediate, material issues affecting expected usage, or annoying NPM deprecation warnings, like [this one](https://github.com/yaniswang/HTMLHint/pull/191).  Our goal is to diverge as little as possible.

**In other words, there will _never_ be any new methods or options added to HTMLHint on this fork, and consequently there will be no minor version or major version bumps from this fork-- only patches.**
