# @sailshq/lesshint

A fork of lesshint v4.6.5 with ongoing maintenance from the [Sails core team](http://sailsjs.com/about).

This repo will only be updated when there are immediate, material issues affecting expected usage, or annoying NPM deprecation warnings, like [this one](https://github.com/lesshint/lesshint/commit/6b71fd0bcbf9cc00ed4076587f5692b72f6e9aa5#commitcomment-28261398).  Our goal is to diverge as little as possible.

**In other words, there will _never_ be any new methods or options added to lesshint on this fork, and consequently there will be no minor version or major version bumps from this fork-- only patches.**
